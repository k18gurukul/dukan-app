# Hadi Kachmar - Mobile developer and programming instructor

My name is Hadi, a Master's degree graduate in computer and communication engineering. I worked as a native mobile developer, then I learned Flutter years ago.  I am willing to share my knowledge and experience with you.

Currently, I am working as an online instructor while focusing on Dart and Flutter to share more and more information with my students.

I am pursuing my knowledge with another master's degree in data science and artificial intelligence to expand my expertise in these domains
